# Advent of Code 2020

This year I'm doing [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) in Clojure. Each exercise is in separate dir.

This requires [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/) to run.

Run N-th day of advent with 
```
cd N
lein run
```

Some days have tests. Run them with
```
cd N
lein test
```

Enjoy the holidays!
